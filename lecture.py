# Binary Search Tree - BST

# Step 1

# In this project, you are going to create a Binary Search Tree (BST). 
# A BST is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child containing values 
# less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the parent node, allowing for 
# efficient searching and sorting operations.

# This is what a Binary Search Tree looks like:

# Begin by defining an empty TreeNode class. The TreeNode class represents a node in a binary search tree. 
# Use the pass keyword to fill the class body and avoid an error.

class TreeNode():
    pass

# Step 2

# Inside the TreeNode class, replace pass with an __init__ method so that you can initialize the attributes 
# of the object. Don't add any parameters and use the pass keyword to avoid an error.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__():
        pass

# Step 3

# The __init__ method takes two parameters: self (which represents the instance of the class being created) 
# and key (the value to be stored in the node). Add those two parameters to the __init__() method.

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        pass
